This python 3 app sends me e-mails to let me know about soccer games that are 
available for streaming on the WatchESPN website.  It reads the credentials for
the gmail account used to send the emails from a file called "gmail_credentials."


You can run it like this:

python futbol_notify.py

and it logs messages to futbol_notify.log.
